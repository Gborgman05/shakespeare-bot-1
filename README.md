# shakespeare-bot-1

## Inspiration

We all love our friends that quote Shakespeare casually, but to read shakespeare is daunting for even the most advanced readers. What if you could consume shakespeare in a casual setting, and in small, bite-sized chunks?

## What it does

Add Shakespeare-bot to your server and use the command:

```!sonnet number```

to have shakespeare-bot tell you what that sonnet is.

## How I built it

Utilized discord.py API and project-gutenberg's repository of Shakespeare.

## Challenges I ran into

Converting Shakespeare's books into a proper lookup-table for sonnets.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Fully setup discord bot you can add to any server! 

## What I learned

- discord.py
- general api integration
- the power of repl.it! Very surprised how extensible it is

## What's next for Shakespeare Bot

1. adding more error checking and sassy-messages when incorrectly talking to Shakespeare-bot
2. adding support for Macbeth and Romeo and Juliet
3. applying NLP techniques to identify shakespeare-insults
